This repository will hold the package build files for packages delivered by
mingw-get from the MinGW SourceForge project.  This files can be used to create
new packages or to maintain existing one.  The template directory is the
starting point for you to create a new package.  Other directories should be
named for the package, without versioning, for the latest version of that
package.
