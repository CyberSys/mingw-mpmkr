This package requires that a -src file exist on SF for the release being built.
To do this you build the wsl library for the new version and do a ``make
dist-w32api'' command which will put the packages into the 
dist/w32api/packages/ directory within the build directory.  Upload those
packages to the FRS site directory for the version being built.  Then you can
use this package system to create the package that will be announced.
